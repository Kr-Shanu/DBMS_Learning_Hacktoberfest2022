## There are many advantages and disadvantages of DBMS (Database Management System). The disadvantages of DBMS are explained below. 

## 1. Increased Cost: 
These are different types of costs: 
 

**Cost of Hardware and Software –**
This is the first disadvantage of the database management system. This is because, for DBMS, it is mandatory to have a high-speed processor and also a large memory size. After all, nowadays there is a large amount of data in every field which needs to be store safely and with security. 
The requirement of this large amount of space and a high-speed processor needs expensive hardware and expensive software too. That is, there is a requirement for sophisticated hardware and software which means that we need to upgrade the hardware which is used for the file-based system. Hardware and Software, both require maintenance which costs very high. All the operating, Training (all levels including programming, application development, and database administration), licensing, and regulatory compliance costs very high. 

 

**Cost of Staff Training –**
Educated staff (database administrator, application programmers, data entry operations) who maintains the database management system also requires a good amount. We need the database system designers to be hired along with application programmers. Alternatively, the services of some software houses need to be taken. So there is a lot of money which needs to be spent on developing software. 
 

**Cost of Data Conversion –** 
We need to convert our data into a database management system, there is a requirement of a lot of money as it adds to the cost of the database management system. This is because for this conversion we need to hire database system designers whom we have to pay a lot of money and also services of some software house will be required. All this shows that a high initial investment for hardware, software, and trained staff is required by DBMS. So, altogether Database Management System results in a costlier system. 
 

## 2. Complexity: 
As we all know that nowadays all companies are using the database management system as it fulfills lots of requirements and also solves the problem. But a problem arises, that is all this functionality has made the database management system an extremely complex software. For the proper requirement of DBMS, it is very important to have a good knowledge of it by the developers, DBA, designers, and also the end-users. This is because if any one of them does not acquire proper and complete skills then this may lead to data loss or database failure. 

These failures may lead to bad design decisions due to which there may be serious and bad consequences for the organization. So this complex system needs to be understood by everyone using it. As it cannot be managed very easily. All this shows that a database management system is not a child’s game as it cannot be managed very easily. It requires a lot of management. A good staff is needed to manage this database at times when it becomes very complicated to decide where to pick data from and where to save it. 

## 3. Currency Maintenance: 
This is very necessary to keep your system current because efficiency which is one of the biggest factors and needs to be overlooked must be maximized. That is we need to maximize the efficiency of the database system to keep our system current. For this, frequent updation must be performed on all the components as new threats come daily. DBMS should be updated according to the current scenario. Also, security measures must be implemented. Due to advancement in database technology, training cost tends to be significant. 

## 4. Performance: 
The traditional file system is written for small organizations and for some specific applications due to which performance is generally very good. But for the small-scale firms, DBMS does not give a good performance as its speed is very slow. As a result, some applications will not run as fast as they could. Hence it is not good to use DBMS for small firms. Because performance is a factor that is overlooked by everyone. If performance is good then everyone (developers, designers, end-users) will use it easily and it will be user-friendly too. As the speed of the system totally depends on the performance so performance needs to be good. 

## 5. Frequency Upgrade/Replacement Cycles: 
Nowadays in this world, we need to stay up-to-date about the latest technologies, developments arriving in the market. Frequent upgrade of the products is done by the DBMS vendors to add new functionality to the systems. New upgrade versions of the software often come bundled. Sometimes these updates also need hardware upgrades. Sometimes these changes and updates are so fast that the users find it difficult to work with that system because it is not easy to learn new commands and understand them again when the new upgrades are done. All these upgrades also cost money to train users, designers, etc. to use the new features.
