# Entity Relationship Model
> ER Model is used to model the logical view of the system from data perspective which consists of these components: 
##### Entity, Entity Type, Entity Set – 
An Entity may be an object with a physical existence – a particular person, car, house, or employee – or it may be an object with a conceptual existence – a company, a job, or a university course. 
An Entity is an object of Entity Type and set of all entities is called as entity set. e.g.; E1 is an entity having Entity Type Student and set of all students is called Entity Set. In ER diagram, Entity Type is represented as:

##### Attributes
Attributes are the **properties which define the entity type**. For example, Roll_No, Name, DOB, Age, Address, Mobile_No are the attributes which defines entity type Student. In ER diagram, attribute is represented by an oval.
